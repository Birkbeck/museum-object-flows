"museumMap", "This map shows the locations of museums in the selected time period. Change the 'filter by' value to alter the way that the points on the map are coloured. Use the 'show only' selection box to limit the types of museum displayed on the map."
"museumCounts", "This bar chart shows the number of museums in the selected time period. Use the 'filter by' box to choose how museums are categorized and the 'show only' box to filter for selected museum types."
"museumHeatmap", "This heatmap shows the number of museums in the selected time period. Museums are grouped according to their classification along the dimensions specified in the 'filter by' and 'dimension 2' boxes. Categories with larger numbers of museums are coloured a darker shade of purple."
"openingsVsClosuresScatter", "This chart shows the the rate at which different types of museums opened and closed over the selected period. Categories which had a large number of openings relative to their size appear higher on the y-axis, while those which had a large number of closures relative to their size appear further along the x-axis. Relatively stable categories therefore appear closer to the origin (marked 'stasis'), while those which have seen a larger amount of change appear further from it. Categories which have had more closures than openings appear beneath the diagonal line, while those which have had more openings appear above it. The size of the points represents the total number of openings and closures. Larger points that are closer to the origin have had a higher absolute number of openings and closures, but these are small in relation to the original size of the category. Smaller points further from the origin have a had a lower absolute number of openings and closures, but they are large in relation to the original size of the category."
"timeSeriesLine", "This chart shows the change in museum numbers over time. Hover the cursor over a line to see how many museums of that type were open in a given year. The lines take into account uncertain opening and closure dates by spreading openings and closures across the range of years in which they might have opened or closed. For example, a museum which opened some time between 2000 and 2009 contributes 0.1 new museums to each of those years. Sometimes, the chart therefore reports the number of museums open in a single year as a fraction. Use the 'filter by' box to change the way museums are categorized and use the 'show only' box to reduce the number of lines on the chart."

"openingsClosures", "This bar chart shows the number of new museum openings and the number of museum closures during the selected time period. The numbers represent the best estimate of openings and closures calculated by summing the number of museums known to have opened or closed in the time period and the probabilities of those that might have opened or closed in the time period. The numbers are rounded to the nearest whole museum. The museums which contribute to this calculation are shown in the 'Museum Openings' and 'Museum Closures' tables below. Use the 'filter by' box to change the way the museums are categorized and use the 'show only' box to reduce the number of bars on the chart."
